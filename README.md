# Computer Vision Project
This repository contains various projects in the field of computer vision. The projects cover topics such as image processing, object detection, and face recognition.

## Coin Detection
This project uses the Hough Circle Transform to detect coins in an image. It identifies the number and locations of the coins and marks them in the output image.

## Lane Line Detection
This project detects lane lines in a road image using edge detection and Hough Transform. The detected lanes are drawn onto the image.

## Eye Pupils Detection
This project detects eye pupils using face detection and eye detection techniques. It marks the pupils in a circular manner for visualization.

## Requirements
- `Python`
- `OpenCV`
- `NumPy`
- `Matplotlib`
