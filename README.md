# Computer Vision Projects
This repository contains various projects in the field of computer vision, covering topics such as coin detection, lane line detection, and eye detection.

## Coin Detection
This project uses the Hough Circle Transform to detect coins in an image. It identifies both the number and locations of the coins and marks them on the output image.

## Lane Line Detection
This project detects lane lines in a road image using edge detection and the Hough Transform. The detected lanes are then drawn onto the image.
